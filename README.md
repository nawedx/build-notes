# Documentation of build process of various Open Source Projects

Documentation of important points, errors and their solutions while building various open source projects. This is my personal experience of building that project. I started documenting this because I keep forgetting stuff and have to again search it up or ask for help.

1. [X.Org](xorg-build-notes/README.md)

Note: Anybody who is also building any open source project can fork this repo and add their experience.
